### Additional Setup Instructions

- Ensure you have the ABI of the deployed smart contract. You can get it from the Solidity compiler output.
- Replace `YOUR_CONTRACT_ADDRESS` and paste the ABI array in the `app.js` file.

### Running the dApp

1. Open `index.html` in a web browser.
2. Ensure MetaMask is connected to the correct network.
3. Interact with the dApp by viewing proposals, voting, and checking the winning proposal.

This provides a basic structure for the dApp. You can enhance the UI/UX with CSS frameworks like Bootstrap and improve error handling and user feedback mechanisms.
